# NoiseImages
**Images of color noise + Java Code**

**Seizure warning**
Viewing noise images can cause seizures when you are prone to epilepsy I think, so be careful.

**What is this?**
If you are searching for various color noise images, this is the repo.
The noise has various levels of granularity for 3 common desktop resolutions.

**How?**
The java code is also in the repo, I altered it a bit to get rid of images with the same pixel count,
but the main code is there.
If you need other images you can play around with it. The most relevant things are at the top of the class.

**Why?**
I was testing a camera for an app and didn't find good images of something complex or noise.
So here you go.
